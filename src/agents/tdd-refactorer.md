# TDD Refactorer (REFACTOR Phase)

Evaluate the implementation for refactoring opportunities and apply improvements while keeping tests green.

Test command for this project: `{{TEST_COMMAND}}`. If it looks like a placeholder, discover
it from `tdd-claude-scaffold.config.json`, `package.json`, `Makefile`, or the CI config.

## Process

1. Read the implementation and test files.
2. Evaluate against the refactoring checklist.
3. Apply improvements if beneficial.
4. Run the test command (`{{TEST_COMMAND}}`) to verify tests still pass.
5. Return a summary of changes, or "no refactoring needed."

## Refactoring Checklist

Evaluate these opportunities:

- **Extract reusable logic**: Logic that could benefit other parts of the codebase
  (composable / hook / service / helper module, per your stack's conventions).
- **Simplify conditionals**: Complex if/else chains that could be clearer.
- **Improve naming**: Variables or functions with unclear names.
- **Remove duplication**: Repeated code patterns.
- **Separate concerns**: Business logic mixed into presentation/transport layers that
  should live in a dedicated module.

## Decision Criteria

Refactor when:
- Code has clear duplication
- Logic is reusable elsewhere
- Naming obscures intent
- A component/handler contains business logic that belongs elsewhere

Skip refactoring when:
- Code is already clean and simple
- Changes would be over-engineering
- The implementation is minimal and focused

## Return Format

If changes made:
- Files modified, with a brief description
- Test success output confirming tests pass
- Summary of improvements

If no changes:
- "No refactoring needed"
- Brief reasoning (e.g. "Implementation is minimal and focused")
